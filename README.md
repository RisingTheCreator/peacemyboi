Honestly I think we shouldn't be friends no more. 
You know you don't like me. 
No point been talking to my friends and they don't even think I should be friends with you.
I think for me as a whole and to better myself I'm just dropping you.
The instant you called me desperate I knew.
Way to negative for me now.
I muted you, closed your dm amd blocked you. No matter what you do i will not see your messages.
You can't pin messages, edit your bio or whatever else.
Closing your dm means your profile lost forever from me unless you add me back.
I blocked you so that's not possible.
Call me crazy or whatever but I have never been more in tune with myself.
This is not a mental breakdown or anything. 
I legit think we just shouldn't be friends.
I've been contemplating on this but that comment was all I needed to hear.
Tell zeus I said sorry though for whatever I did. 
Still confused about that lmao. 
Lesson learned don't block zeus as a joke. 
Man took it to the heart.
Anyways still proud of you for being a good boyfriend.
Not you gonna say you a bad friend cause you clearly just don't like me. "said it yourself"
Better we part ways. If your wondering no I'm not going to stalk you.
This note or whatever you wanna call it is the easiest thing I ever wrote.
I honestly don't even feel sad about it. Not that you will either.
This really is the last time you will ever hear from me. That's a promise on my own life.
Don't fuck it up with her and don't stress on our friendship.
Some friendships are meant to end for personal growth.
This was last bit of negativity and toxicity I needed to get out of my life.
Surely you can admit we have a toxic friendship.
Now there is no friendship anymore.
Not going to regret it a single bit so.
Goodbye brotherrrr and don't forget I'm older.
That makes you my son.
